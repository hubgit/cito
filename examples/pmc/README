This example demonstrates the utility of a CiTO javascript function, that allows creation of CiTO RDF triples in a research article's reference list, 
and submission of these triples to an external database that collates triples from all users.

The CiTO javascript files have been included in the code as follows:

<script id='citojs' type="text/javascript" src="./javascript/cito.js?reftype=pubmed"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./javascript/cito.css">
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="./javascript/jquery.min.js"></script>


Additionally, the <body> HTML tag has been modified as follows:
<body onload='cito()'>

This modification will call the cito() function to modify the HTML in the page.

To run this example locally, download the example and open the 
"Pathema  a clade-specific bioinformatics resource center for pathogen research.html" file in a web browser.
